# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0
============================================
## Background Context
The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.

## Task 0: Give me a page!
In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.

After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains Hello Holberton. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.
